## ID3-Classification-Algorithm
This project implements the ID3 algorithm, a decision tree learning algorithm used for classification tasks. The algorithm builds a decision tree by recursively selecting the attribute that maximizes information gain. It's a foundational algorithm in machine learning, particularly useful for educational purposes and understanding how decision trees work.

### Features:
Data Input: Accepts datasets in CSV format.

Tree Construction: Automatically builds a decision tree based on the input data.

Classification: Classifies new data based on the constructed decision tree.

### Usage:
Training: Train the algorithm using a labeled dataset.

Prediction: Use the trained model to classify new data points.

Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using test datasets. Displays accuracy metrics.
